  <h1>Earth Overshoot</h1>
  
  <p>Earth Overshoot Day is the date on which humanity’s resource consumption for the year exceeds Earth’s capacity to regenerate those resources that year.</p>

  <p>The effects of this are worrying – climate change, shrinking forests, species loss, collapsing fisheries, higher commodity prices and civil unrest. </p>
  
  <p>If we keep consuming, data shows us on track to require the resources of two planets well before mid-2000-century.</p>
   
  <p>Click to answer 5 questions to find out what the world in 2040 would look like if everyone was just like you and when your Earth Overshoot Day would be.</p>

          <p>Pre flood fashion is the big trend this season! Designer Rachel T brings back the old world in her new collection, despite its lack of practicality in the today’s water based society. It reminds us of passed times - sitting in the streets of Paris or New York with a cup of coffee and a croissant. This kind of nostalgia reflects in her looks - contemporary natural nautical materials flirt with these valuable items produced on land.</p>'

      <h1>Energy Police Shuts Down Beauty Salons</h1>
      <img src = "http://estaticos02.elmundo.es/elmundo/imagenes/2010/08/11/baleares/1281465410_extras_ladillos_2_0.jpg">
      <p>By CHRISTOPHER MELER and NIRAJ CHOKSHICK</p>
      <p>In an attempt to conserve the last remaining energy supplies in the United States, the Energy Police have shut down all beauty salons citing excessive use of water and heat. This is fifth industry to be hit by the recent regulation that bans “frivolous” use of energy, after the high profile shutdown of the aviation business.</p>
      <p>Housewife Sylvia B., 45, said “It was somehow ok when they forced me washing my dishes by hand, but I really don’t know how to sleek my hair manually”.</p>

      <h1>Land Mafia Takes Over Last Island</h1>
      <img src=images/landmafia.jpg>
      <p>By ASHTON JERRY and RUDO NGOZI</p>
      <p>6:00 AM EST</p>
      <p>The world’s most dangerous land mafia LandKill took over the planet’s last remaining landmass in a violent attack last night. </p>
      <p>After the great flood in 2038 the mafia became more and more influential recruiting their members amongst underprivileged people without access to food or floating devices.  “It is easy to understand” so Christian J., president of the Organisation for Landmass Distribution “losing 60% of all humankind to the flood puts the ones without land or tools to fish in a position of anger. This is perfect fertile soil for the terrorists. They promise them huge Floating Devices and a bright future in the community.”</p>
      <p>The people who were actually living on this last piece of land, which used to be Equador, were kicked barbarously into the water by the mafia to fend for themselves. </p>
